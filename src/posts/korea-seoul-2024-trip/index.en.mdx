This November, my friend and I took a 5-day, 4-night trip to Korea — my very first time visiting! The main goals? Dressing up in a hanbok and making a little pilgrimage to see T1 (yes, I'm T1 fan 😆). On a whim, I thought I'd jot down our itinerary and experiences to share with anyone who's curious or planning their own trip.

## 🗓 Itinerary

### Day 1 Arriving in Hongdae & Han River Ramen ||day-1||

As soon as we landed, we grabbed tickets for the AREX express train from Gimpo Airport to Hongik University Station. The ticket design was so cute I didn't even want to return it to get the deposit back!

We got to the hotel a little after 6 p.m., dropped off our bags, and immediately dashed out to the Han River.<br/>
On the way, we stopped by a couple of convenience stores hoping to find a cute T-money card. The selection was kinda meh, but eventually, I found a KAKAO Friends one featuring Chunshik at a nearby CU. Still adorable, so no complaints!

#### Han River Ramen 🍜 ||han-river-ramen||

We got off at Yeouido Station and randomly came across Deft’s lightbox 💙 I mean, it is Mapo District after all, so maybe it’s not that surprising… but still, what a lucky find!

    },

/>

We wandered in the direction where most of the food stalls were, and spotted a 7-Eleven on the ground floor below a BHC Chicken — that's where we grabbed our ramen.

The selection of instant noodles at this 7-Eleven wasn't as huge as I expected, but they did have lots of toppings and even cups of ice you could buy.

To be honest, eating ramen at the Han River wasn't the most exciting thing in the world — it cost over 300 NTD (around $10 USD), and we were mostly just sitting around. But if you're into night views or just want to soak in a laid-back, chill vibe, it's a fun little experience. Lots of people were either eating noodles, lying down listening to music, or just enjoying the night air.

#### Able Guesthouse Hongdae 🏠 ||able-guesthouse-hongdae||

After having ramen, we made a beeline back to the guesthouse — and I've got to sneak in a little recommendation here: Able Guesthouse Hongdae!

It's just a 5-minute walk from the AREX airport express station, which is super convenient — especially on the day you're hauling your luggage to the airport. It's about a 10-minute walk to the subway, so not right next to it, but manageable.

The place has more of a youth hostel vibe. It's on the 3rd floor with no elevator (just stairs), and you'll be sharing the floor with other guest rooms. We stayed in a double-bed room — nothing fancy, but clean enough to pass the test. The bathroom was actually really tidy, and they provided good-quality toiletries, which was a nice surprise.

For the not-so-great part: **Soundproofing**<br/>
Around 11 p.m. to 2 a.m., we could clearly hear our neighbors chatting away. If you're a light sleeper, maybe pack some earplugs.

**BUT!** Here's the part that totally won me over 😂 — they include breakfast! Inside the fridge, you'll find toast, jam, eggs, milk, juice, and more. You've gotta cook it yourself, but still, it's super thoughtful. Every morning when I grabbed the milk, I silently thanked the host, LOL.

> One thing to note though: they **don't provide free drinking water**. There's a box of bottled water you can buy from, but we just stocked up on drinks during our outings anyway.

### Day 2 Gyeongbokgung Palace & T1 HQ ||day-2||

#### Palace Fox Hanbok 🦊 ||palace-fox-hanbok||

One of the things I was most excited about on this trip was wearing a hanbok — and after lots of scrolling through REDnote, I ended up choosing Palace Fox Hanbok. You can make a reservation through Xiaohongshu without paying in advance, which is super convenient. The shop is literally right next to the subway station too!<br/>
The staff there were so sweet — lots of them speak Chinese, so no need to worry about any language barrier. Everyone was really friendly and helpful.

First, you pick a skirt (you can **try on one**), then a top (you’re allowed to **try on two**). No need to stress about sizes — they have everything from standard to plus sizes. If you’re stuck on colors or just indecisive (me 🙋‍♀️), the staff will help you pick something that looks great. After you’ve chosen, they’ll take you to the fitting room and help you get dressed.

Heads up: you’ll be asked to take off your top because hanboks can be a little sheer, so wearing a tank top or something similar is a good idea. I wore a white camisole underneath. They also add a free petticoat, which seriously makes a huge difference — way more elegant and flowy! Since the skirt is long, you don’t need to take off your bottoms.

Next, you can choose to get your hair styled. I skipped the braid but went for a floral hair clip for ₩5,000 — apparently, that’s the usual price for short hair. They also have free traditional hairbands if you want a more classic look. Finally, I only picked a cute little handbag (free!) to complete the outfit.

The hanboks at this shop come in three tiers — Fashion, Premium, and VIP. The one I picked was a **Premium Hanbok**, and with the floral hair accessory, the total came to just ₩29,000 — such a steal! ✧*｡٩(ˊᗜˋ*)و✧\*｡ I was honestly so happy with how it turned out. We took a ton of photos — I might’ve gone a little overboard with the selfies 😂

Since we were only planning to visit Gyeongbokgung Palace, we opted for the 2-hour rental, which turned out to be more than enough. We even ended up returning the hanbok a bit early!

Visiting Gyeongbokgung in November is very beautiful — the streets are lined with golden ginkgo trees, and inside the palace grounds, you’ll see trees in all shades: green, red, yellow… it’s like walking through a painting. Plus, the weather was perfect — not too hot, not too cold — which made wearing a hanbok super comfortable. Honestly, couldn’t have picked a better time to go!

#### Tosokchon Samgyetang 🐓 ||tosokchon-samgyetang||

We only had to wait about 10 minutes before getting seated in the annex building — not bad at all considering how popular this place is! Each of us ordered a bowl of their signature ginseng chicken soup. The chicken itself was super tender and flavorful, and it was definitely filling.

That said… I’ve gotta admit, I found it kind of underwhelming. I think it’s just personal taste — I’m not the biggest fan of medicinal ingredients like ginseng and jujube, so the soup didn’t really wow me. I had high hopes for the glutinous rice stuffed inside the chicken, but it had a strange sweetness (probably from the dates?) that really threw me off. Ended up not finishing it.

I even wore team jersey and went wild taking pics everywhere. Sadly, the jerseys and jackets were already sold out in-store, but there was still a good selection of smaller merch. Just ask the staff directly if you’re looking for something specific. I ended up just grabbing a full sticker set — definitely more worth it than going through a proxy for these little items.

#### Yukhoe Sisters House 🥩 ||yukhoe-sisters-house||

When we got to Buchon Yukhoe, there were 43 groups ahead of us (!!), so yeah… instant nope. Luckily, another place I had saved was just up the street — Yukhoe Sisters House — and we walked right in, no wait. It was still super packed inside though, so we figured it had to be good.

As soon as you sit down, they serve you a warm radish pork soup — slightly spicy and super tasty. The yukhoe (raw beef) came with slices of pear, which I wasn’t too keen on eating them together, but the pear was delicious on its own.

### Day 3 Strolling Around Hongdae & T1 Base Camp ||day-3||

#### Hongdae Shopping ||hongdae-shopping||

To be honest, I’m not the biggest fan of shopping, so I just wandered around. But, there were a few places I’d definitely recommend:

- **OFFLINE DUTY FREE**: This two-story store has everything from bags and shoes to accessories, and the best part? It’s super affordable! I’d recommend grabbing cute little hair clips or necklaces here. The bags are cheap too, but some of the quality isn’t the best, so just be mindful.
- **Å LAND**: A trendy clothing store, but the real gem is in the corner — they sell cute little trinkets. I ended up getting a cat sticker there (haha). If you shop here, remember to do your tax refund at the airport.
- **SPAO**: Located near Hongdae subway, I went specifically for a down jacket. It fits super well and looks great! I grabbed a black, hooded one for around NT$1,600, and the best part is you can do tax refunds right there.
- **Butter**: Don’t let the fact that it sells cute stuff fool you into thinking it’s expensive. Most of the items, like card holders and mini bags, are around ₩9,900. Everything is ridiculously adorable, and the store is great for photos. In the end, I bought a plush teddy bear bag (so cute!), but I kinda wish I bought more while I was there!

#### MintChoco World 🍫 ||mint-choco-world||

For all **mint chocolate lovers** out there, this place is a must-try 🩵 After falling in love with the super-thin chocolate vibe thanks to SUNOO, I had to stop by this place.

Right as you walk in, you’re greeted with a huge variety of breads, though I’m not a huge bread person. I opted for a drink, and for the added bonus — if you check-in on Ins, they’ll even give you some meringue!

      alt: 'MintChoco World Product Area',
    },
  ]}
/>

As soon as we entered, we ordered a drink each. The Mint Choco Latte is essentially mint chocolate milk with an intense mint flavor. If you’re not a big fan, proceed with caution. We also tried a Mint Choco Tiramisu, which paired perfectly with the drinks. The tiramisu’s mint flavor wasn’t too overwhelming, and its sweetness was absolutely delicious! As we drank, the minty taste lingered and became stronger, with my friend still tasting mint hours later (ᗒᗨᗕ).

#### Boseung Hall ||boseung-hall||

We only waited about five minutes before getting seated. I ordered the rice sausage soup (?), and it wasn’t bad, but also not amazing. I originally thought the soup and rice would be cooked together, but they were served separately. The blood sausage (the black one) was really good, but there was also this white winter noodle sausage that had a chewy texture — not my favorite. Plus, it was super hot that day, and we were sitting by the window, so the soup was scalding. Eating it was a bit of a struggle, to be honest.

#### T1 Base Camp 🎮 ||t1-base-camp||

Just came here to look around — didn’t log in at the PC café or anything 😆 Just walked around taking tons of photos, went to the nearby shop to buy some tattoo stickers and a Faker fan, then ended the visit by going crazy at the photo booth. Felt super happy! Definitely coming back next time to actually play games and try the ramen (even though Faker said it’s expensive lol).

#### MOM's TOUCH 🍗 ||moms-touch||

Each of us ordered a small box, but even that was kind of a big portion for girls — we ended up snacking on it all the way until bedtime back at the hotel 😂 But it was so good! The chicken was super tender, and the crispy coating stayed delicious even when it got cold. Highly recommend grabbing a box to try!!!

We got really lucky — only waited about 10 minutes before getting a table! And just a few minutes after ordering, the food came flying out. Super fast, no wonder it’s such a well-known spot.

The pork back-bone stew was so good — the meat was fall-off-the-bone tender. The only downside was there were just two small pieces of potato, but it was still super filling. The broth was rich and flavorful, though you do have to order rice separately.

Dropped by this vintage shop that SUNOO had visited, and ended up loving the place way more than expected! The section to the left of the entrance was packed with stylish finds. Most items were around NT$200, and yes, you can try things on.<br/>
I scored a super cute knit top and a diamond-patterned jacket for under NT$400 — such a steal!

#### Happy Soy Sauce Rice（행복은 간장밥）🍤 ||korean-restaurants-happy-soyrice||

This was the meal I was most excited for — I’ve been wanting to try soy-marinated shrimp forever, and finally found a cozy little spot to give it a go. When we got there, the place was completely empty (hidden gem vibes!). I ordered the sweet soy-marinated salmon and shrimp rice bowl. A little on the pricey side, but honestly? Totally worth it. It lived up to the name — it was pure happiness in a bowl. I was taking tiny bites just to make it last longer 😭💖

#### Kitchen Spring 🍙 ||kitchen-spring||

This place seems to fly under the tourist radar — definitely more of a local gem. The owner was super busy, and it’s best to have your translator ready before ordering. We went for a mixed set, and the owner told us it’d be about an hour wait (yup, that good!). Since we hadn’t had dinner yet, we said no problem and came back later to pick it up.

Totally worth the wait — it was so good and super filling too. My personal fave was the egg kimbap — rich flavor, tons of egg, just perfect. The tuna one was tasty too, though it had shredded cabbage inside, which I’m not a fan of (raw veggies aren’t really my thing 😅). My friend loved both, though!

### Day 5 Bye Korea~~ ||day-5||

We wrapped up the trip early in the morning and headed out. Honestly, the hotel location was perfect — right next to the AREX line. It only took about five minutes to walk to the station with luggage, and there was an escalator at the exit, so no struggling up stairs with our bags!

A small regret before leaving was that my flight was pretty early (had to fly out at 11 AM), so I didn’t have time to grab the sweet potato bread I had been craving at Lotte Department Store. Guess I’ll just have to go back next time!

> BTW, flying with EasyJet wasn’t the most comfortable experience. The seats were a bit painful after sitting for a while, and I didn’t sleep well at all.

## 💸 Personal Expenses ||personal-expenses||

I brought US$ 300 to exchange into Korean Won, but when I arrived in Korea, I needed to catch the AREX, so I didn’t want to buy a T-money card at the airport (I was hoping to find a cute one elsewhere). So I exchanged just ₩5,500 at Songshan Airport to get me started.

- Flight tickets（TSA ↔ GMP）：NT$ 8,621 per person
- [Accommodation](#able-guesthouse-hongdae)：NT$ 3,205 per person
- Pre-trip preparations (eSIM + adapter): NT$152
- Transportation: About NT$323 (I topped up ₩14,000 and still had a little left)
- Food, drinks & shopping: NT$14,065 (OY spent NT$3,787, and I used LINE Pay JCB for most purchases)

**Total: NT$ 26,366**

Honestly, it ended up being a little more than I expected, but my friend was super happy with the trip (she stayed within her budget). My friends back home also thought I was super frugal considering how many places we visited, so overall, my first trip to Korea was a huge success! ヾ(●´▽｀●)ノ
